## Introduction

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is a triennial cross-sectional survey of U.S. families. 

The survey data include information on families' balance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic characteristics. 

Information is also included from related surveys of pension providers and the earlier such surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. 

No other study for the country collects comparable information. 

Data from the SCF are widely used, from analysis at the Federal Reserve and other branches of government to scholarly work at the major economic research centers.
